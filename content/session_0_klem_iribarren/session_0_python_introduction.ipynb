    "There are a variety of ways to install packages. You can install the source code from the associated website, or from a GitHub repository, or from a distribution platform. PIP is an example of a Python package manager and distribution platform. You can peruse the Python packages available for installation via PIP on the [Python Package Index (PyPI) distribution platform](https://pypi.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) (also see [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/)) is also a package manager, but it is much more than that. Besides installing and updating packages Anaconda also creates and manages virtual environments. You can think of a virtual environment as a new computer, independent of any other environment on the computer. This becomes very important if a package you want to use requires a specific version of another package (for example, maybe it requires a Python version < 3.0), but you have other packages that require other versions of Python. You can use the conda create command to create a virtual environment that is tailored to the dependency requirements of specific packages or systems. If the package has been distributed on Anaconda you will be able to find conda installation instructions for it. Or you can also use pip to install the package- just make sure you are using the pip assigned to your conda environment (this can be checked by running which pip and making sure it is located in the path of your conda environment). Lastly, Anaconda supports management for non-Python packages, so it is much broader that pip/PyPi which is only Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on shared computing resources it is often required to use virtual environmets by using conda or venv. [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is solely a virtual environment manager and can be used similarly to Anaconda, however, it is only for managing Python packages. "
