    "The goal of this notebook is to introduce TS-tools, a useful open-source software package that facilitate the automated generation of reaction profiles, starting from a simple reaction SMILES input (see figure below for a schematic overview of the algorithm; more information about the technical detail can be found in the associated paper -- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.27374). Compared to autodE, TS-tools is particularly suited for transition states involving 3 or more reactants, which are relevant for example in solvent- and autocatalysis, as well as enzymatic reactivity.\n",
