Amanda has been a librarian at Carolina since 2002. Her background is in geography and geospatial technology. As the Head of Digital Research Services, she leads a team of data and technology experts and oversees the Research Hub in Davis Library. Services offered include support for scholars using geospatial technology, spatial and numeric data, statistics, data visualization, and other digital scholarship methods. Since 2019, Amanda has been working on a collections as data project called On the Books: Jim Crow and Algorithms of Resistance. She is currently investigating how the products of this project can be used in research and teaching, and hopes to identify best practices for librarians interested in supporting these types of collections.
