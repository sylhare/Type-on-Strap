Dr. Villamil's creative scholarship explores the intersection of environmentalism, social sustainability and cultural identity in rural and Native American communities in Appalachia and the American Southeast. Major projects include Creating a Culture of Health in Appalachia: Bright Spots and Disparities, a 13-state, multi-part research study for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Appalachian Regional Commission, the Ohio Water Project, a public clearinghouse for the Appalachian Ohio Valley, and UX and data product design for remote water quality monitoring technology being innovated by a team of environmental scientists and engineers. Currently, she is working with the Coharie Tribe of North Carolina helping to explore entrepreneurial possibilities for kayaking and recreation along the Great Coharie River.
