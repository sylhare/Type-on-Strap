Dr. Martin's interest areas include economic and community development, immigration and local political conflicts, restructuring of urban labor markets, the management of nonprofit organizations, and the transnational lives of migrants. Her current research is on the transformation of Durham, North Carolina from a de-industrialized city to a “revitalized” city characterized by pretentious consumption.
