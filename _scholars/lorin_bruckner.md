Iâ€™ve been the Data Visualization Services Librarian in Digital Research Services since 2016. Before working at the University Library, I was employed for 10 years as a web designer and creative director. I obtained my MS in Information Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My other interests include text mining and natural language processing.
