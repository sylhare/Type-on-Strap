The Stanford AI Lab (SAIL) Blog is a place for SAIL students, faculty, and researchers to share our work with the general public. We will write about our latest research, [discussions](http://ai.stanford.edu/events/ai-salon/) and [talks](http://ai.stanford.edu/events/ai-distinguished-speakers-series/) held at SAIL, and other interesting updates from our labs. To learn more about the various AI research being done at SAIL, visit [the SAIL website](http://ai.stanford.edu/).

All our blog posts are written by members in the SAIL community, with faculty advisor [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/) and the following editorial board:

* [Andrey Kurenkov](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/)
