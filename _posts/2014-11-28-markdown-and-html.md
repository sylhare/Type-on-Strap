Jekyll supports the use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.

## Table of content

<!-- To be placed at the beginning of the post, it is where the table of content will be generated -->
* TOC
  {:toc}
* 
You need to put this at the beginning of the page where you want the table of content to be displayed

```html
* TOC
{:toc}
```

It will then render the markdown and html titles (lines that begins with `#` or using the `<h1></h1>` tages)


## Title

### Subtitle

Tables have also been extended from Markdown:

| First Header | Second Header |
|--------------|---------------|
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |

Here's an example of an image, which is included using Markdown:

![Image of a glass on a book]({{ "/assets/img/pexels/book-glass.jpeg" | relative_url }})

This is another example of list:
 
 - list of things
   1. Sub list
   2. of Other things
   3. with numbers
 - And many more
   - Sub sub list
     - can go on ...
       - and on ...
         - and on !
   - That's it.
   
### Other subtitle

Highlighting for code in Jekyll is done using Base16 or Rouge. This theme makes use of Rouge by default.

{% highlight js %}
// count to ten
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

// count to twenty
var j = 0;
while (j < 20) {
    j++;
    console.log(j);
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Math

Type on Strap uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as $$S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$$ can be displayed inline.

Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:

$$ f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2} $$
