#### Which online course site is "best"? 
There is no clearly superior platform and many courses are cross-listed on several. Udemy, Coursera, EdX, and FutureLearn are similar and tend to host the largest variety of courses. Udacity is more streamlined into career-oriented paths. Codecademy is more focused on general computer programming and Data Camp is a "gamified" introduction. For a curated list of courses check out the repositories for each language or program in the [rest of the guide](https://data-scholars-discovery-guide.github.io/Table_of_Contents/).
