Stata is a private software for data management, analysis, and visualization. Since it is privately owned and developed it costs money to use, but the intuitive functions, high-quality support guides, and capacity for managing large datasets can be worth it for some fields. 

Stata is the standard program for most social scientists (economists, sociologists, demographers, etc) due to its specialization in survey data analysis. Its interactive "point-and-click" menus can also make analysis and plotting easier for beginners.

Since Stata isn't open source there is not as large of a package environment as with Python or R but it is possible to install user-made programs. Stata does not tend to support multiple datasets, spatial data, or machine learning methods as much as Python or R.
