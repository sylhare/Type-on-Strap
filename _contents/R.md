## [R Project Website](https://www.r-project.org/)
## [RStudio Website](https://www.rstudio.com/)

R is an open-source programming language used by a wide variety of scientists for data management, analysis, and visualization. It offers a large community of users and an array of user-created packages (which provide functions for everything from web applications to machine learning).

RStudio is the most common user-interface for R. Without it, R programmers used to code directly from the command line. RStudio makes it easy to create and edit R-scripts, manage files, view plots, and much more. 

We highly recommend that you install both (RStudio won't work without R) and start off in the RStudio environment.

## General Resource Guides
[RStudio: Resources](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/) - The wonderful folks at RStudio collected resources for downloading and installing R and RStudio, starting out learning R, and special guides for Shiny and R Markdown. A great place to start.

[Open Source Data Science Masters: R Guide](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go/blob/master/r-resources.md) - A comprehensive collection of resources for R from the [OSDM](http://datasciencemasters.org/) folks, who also have a great guide for baseline data skills and Python.

## Complete Tutorials
[R-Statistics.co: R Tutorial](http://r-statistics.co/R-Tutorial.html) - Concise written introduction to R programming with example code by Selva Prabhakaran. Further tutorials available for everything from plotting to regression and time series!

[Data Camp: Data Scientist with R Career Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-r) - Over 23 interactive tutorials for all things data science in R! DataCamp offers some free courses but most require a premium account for $29 per month. If you're okay with paying for high-quality courses and don't want to search around for different guides, DataCamp has everything in one place.

## Beginner's Guides
[Udemy: R Programming A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/r-programming/) - Interactive video course from the SuperDataScience Team for basic programming in R. Usually $12 for the complete course (Udemy has "sales" almost every day and lots of great courses).

[UC Berkeley D-Lab: R Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals) - GitHub repo containing template .Rmd scripts for introductory R programming. To start learning, download the repo as a .zip file using the "Clone or Download" button in green at the top right. Extract the folder and open the "R Fundamentals Part 1 Introduction.Rmd" using RStudio.

[UC Berkeley D-Lab: Fast R](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Fast-R) - Consolidated version of the R Fundamentals GitHub repo.

[DataCamp: Free Intro to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) - Basics of R and its data types with 4 hours of video and 62 exercises.

# Intermediate Guides
[UC Berkeley D-Lab: Data Wrangling (dplyr)](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-wrang) - GitHub repo on cleaning and manipulating data in R with the popular dplyr package. Structured similarly to R Fundamentals. Use the "tutorial.Rmd" file to start learning!

[UC Berkeley D-Lab: Data Visualization (ggplot2)](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-graphics) - GitHub repo on making plots in R with the popular ggplot2 package.

[R-Statistics.co: ggplot2 Tutorial](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html) - Online guide to using ggplot2 with example code.

[R-Statistics.co: ggplot2 Quick Reference](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-cheatsheet.html) - Helpful reference guide of ggplot2 commands with examples.

[RStudio: ggplot2 Cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) - PDF of almost all ggplot2 commands with options. If you do a lot of diverse plotting, I highly recommend printing it out and keeping it next to your computer!
