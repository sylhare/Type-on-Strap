The Wayback Show is a trip back in time to remember some of the classic rock songs from the 1960's & 70's, sometimes the 80's. So head back down yester-year's memory lane or maybe discover some great classic tunes for the first time! Tune in to Tropico FM, KFFI 103.1 FM Boise 4-6 pm, Mountain Time.
