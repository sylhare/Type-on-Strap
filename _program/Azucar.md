Noel Argote-Herrera was born in La Habana, Cuba. So was his mother, Adelfa. His father Anibal,  was born in the city of Manzanillo, Oriente, Cuba. They arrived as Refugees in 1970. Noel grew up in Gary, Indiana, Miami Beach and Los Angeles. He plays what's known as  "El Son Cubano” which is based on the Trova movement of Indigenous Cuban folklore music. Initially it started in the province Oriente where his father was from. The Conga, invented in Cuba, derived from the African Djembe Drum.
